This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
y <- Duncan$prestige
X <- cbind(rep(1, 45),Duncan$income,Duncan$education)
```
```{r}
solve(t(X) %*% X) * 7506.699/42
```
```{r}
 lse <- lm(prestige ~ income + education, data=Duncan)
summary(lse)
```
```{r}
Xstar <- scale(X[,c(2,3)], scale=c(F,F)) # centering only, not full standardization 
ystar <- scale(y, center=T, scale=F)
(solve(t(Xstar) %*% Xstar))  * 7506.699
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
